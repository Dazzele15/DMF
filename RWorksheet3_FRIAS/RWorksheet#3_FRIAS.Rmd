```{r vector1.a}
 #Using Vectors
#1.	There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
 #LETTERS	
##	[1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N" "O" "P" "Q" "R" "S" ## [20] "T" "U" "V" "W" "X" "Y" "Z"
 #letters	
##	[1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" ## [20] "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"


#Based on the above vector LETTERS:
#a.	You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.

LETTERS <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z")
